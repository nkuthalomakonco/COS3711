Write an application that uses regular expressions to check for telephone numbers and email addresses in a text file provided by a user. The following functionality should be included.
• The user should be able to select the file to check using a standard file open dialog box.
• The file should be displayed in the GUI.
• The telephone numbers and email addresses should be highlighted/emphasized in some way in the text.
An email address can be identified by a single @ symbol in the address; telephone numbers could be from any of the following formats:
• 000-000-0000
• 000-0000000
• 0000000000
• (000)000-0000
• (000)0000000
You may assume that the email addresses and telephone numbers are free standing, that is, they do not have brackets (or any other character) around them.
